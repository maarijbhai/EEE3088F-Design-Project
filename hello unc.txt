hello unc here is the work split:
if you can edit this say "hi neph"

hi neph
mj:
Integrate USB C and get 9V out of the USB Host

unc:
Operate up to 4 motors bidirectionally with the pins available to you (listed in the power pinout
table). You will need to control 2x brushed DC motors which could each draw 200mA at the
highest voltage of a 1S1P battery (the battery is further specified in the battery section).
The other 2x motors are for the auxiliary connection and need to operate 500mA each

Place an INA219 for monitoring the battery on the I2C Bus and configure it correctly with
respect to the hardware (cannot have BOTH A0 AND A1 on GND

Charge the battery from the 9V input pin (listed in the power pinout table).
